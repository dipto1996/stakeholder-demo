To qualify for an H-1B visa, the beneficiary must meet specific criteria related to their education and experience. The position itself must also qualify as a specialty occupation. A specialty occupation requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.

The beneficiary must meet one of the following criteria:
1. Hold a U.S. bachelor’s degree or higher required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university.
2. Hold a foreign degree determined to be the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree or higher required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university.
3. Hold an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes the beneficiary to fully practice the specialty occupation and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment.
4. Have education, specialized training, or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S. bachelor’s degree or higher in the specialty occupation, and have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.
