Optional Practical Training (OPT) is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization after completing their degree. Students with a qualifying STEM degree may be eligible for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT.

To maintain F-1 status during post-completion OPT, the student must work at least 20 hours per week in a paid or unpaid position directly related to their field of study. When traveling abroad, the student must carry their Form I-20, endorsed for travel by the Designated School Official (DSO) within the last six months, a valid passport, a valid F-1 visa, and their Employment Authorization Document (EAD). A letter from their employer is also highly recommended. The student’s SEVIS record must be up-to-date with their current employer's information.
