# Short answer
SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) is a federal database that tracks F, M, and J visa holders and their dependents throughout their stay in the U.S.

# Detailed guidance
- Managed by ICE's SEVP division.  
- Schools and sponsors update SEVIS with status changes (enrollment, address, completion).  
- Each F/M/J visa holder has a SEVIS ID starting with "N00."  
- Dependents (F-2, M-2, J-2) are linked to the principal's record.  
- Failure to maintain SEVIS compliance can result in status termination.  

# Key requirements
- Keep SEVIS record current via DSO/sponsor.  
- Report address changes within 10 days.  
- Maintain full-time enrollment.  
- Obtain new I-20/DS-2019 before major changes.  

# Atomic claims
- SEVIS tracks international students and dependents in real time (critical: true)
- Failure to maintain SEVIS compliance can lead to status termination (critical: true)
- Each F/M/J visa holder has unique SEVIS ID linked to their record (critical: false)
