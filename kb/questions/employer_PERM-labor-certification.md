# Short answer
The employer must conduct required recruitment, file an ETA Form 9089 through the DOL's FLAG system, and demonstrate that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the position.

# Detailed guidance
- The PERM process (20 CFR §656) requires:
  - Obtaining a prevailing wage determination (PWD) from the DOL;
  - Conducting mandatory recruitment steps (newspaper ads, job order, etc.);
  - Reviewing and documenting all applicants objectively;
  - Filing ETA Form 9089 electronically;
  - Retaining recruitment and audit files for five years.
- The job requirements must reflect actual business necessity and not be tailored to the foreign worker.
- The process must be employer-driven, with no employee self-sponsorship.

# Key requirements
- Valid PWD from DOL.  
- Required recruitment completed.  
- Good faith applicant review.  
- Proper ETA Form 9089 filing.  
- Five-year record retention.
