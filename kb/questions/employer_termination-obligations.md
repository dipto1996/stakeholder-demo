# Short answer
When terminating an H-1B worker, an employer must notify USCIS, withdraw the LCA, and offer to pay the reasonable cost of return transportation to the worker's last foreign residence.

# Detailed guidance
- A bona fide termination requires:
  - Written notice to USCIS requesting withdrawal of the petition.
  - Withdrawal of the LCA from DOL's FLAG system.
  - Payment of return transportation for the employee (not dependents).
  - Final paycheck consistent with wage obligations.
- Failure to complete all steps leaves wage liability continuing until proper termination.
- The employer should maintain termination documentation for records.

# Key requirements
- USCIS and DOL withdrawal notices.  
- Return transportation offered.  
- Documented termination process.  
- Record retention for audit protection.

- Employers must notify USCIS and withdraw LCA when terminating H-1B worker (critical: true)
- Employers must offer to pay cost of return transportation to worker's last foreign residence (critical: true)
