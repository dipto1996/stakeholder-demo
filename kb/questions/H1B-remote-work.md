# Short answer
No. H-1B authorizes work tied to a U.S. worksite; employer must file Form I-129 with a certified LCA for the U.S. location.

# Detailed guidance
- **Step 1:** Confirm the worksite and LCA wage obligations for the U.S. location.
- **Step 2:** Prepare and file Form I-129 with supporting employer letter and beneficiary evidence (degree, credentials).
- **Step 3:** If worker remains abroad, follow consular processing for visa issuance at U.S. embassy/consulate.

# Key requirements
- H-1B is for specialty occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher
- Work must be performed at a U.S. worksite (cannot be remote from India)
- Employer must obtain a certified Labor Condition Application (LCA) from Department of Labor
- LCA specifies the worksite location and prevailing wage
- Worker must be paid the required wage even if working remotely within the U.S.
