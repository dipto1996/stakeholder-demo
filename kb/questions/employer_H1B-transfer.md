# Short answer
An employer may hire an existing H-1B worker by filing a new Form I-129 petition; employment with the new company may begin once USCIS receives the petition, provided the worker maintains valid H-1B status.

# Detailed guidance
- Under INA §214(n) and 8 CFR § 214.2(h)(2)(i)(H), portability allows a new employer to employ the worker upon USCIS receipt of the petition and before approval.
- The new LCA must cover the new work location and wage.
- Prior H-1B status must be unbroken and lawful.
- The new employer assumes all H-1B obligations (wages, working conditions, recordkeeping).
- If the petition is denied, employment must cease immediately.

# Key requirements
- Valid H-1B status at time of filing.  
- Receipt notice from USCIS.  
- Certified LCA for new worksite.  
- Timely petition submission.

# Atomic claims
- Portability under INA §214(n) permits employment upon receipt of new H-1B petition (critical: true)
