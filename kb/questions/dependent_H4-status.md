# Short answer
H-4 status is granted to the spouse and unmarried children under 21 of a principal H-1B worker, allowing them to reside in the U.S. for the same duration as the H-1B holder.

# Detailed guidance
- Derivative status tied to the principal H-1B worker's petition validity.  
- No independent work authorization unless separately eligible.  
- Must maintain same period of admission as principal.  
- Change of status or extension filed via Form I-539.  
- Children age-out when turning 21 (see CSPA rules).

# Key requirements
- Legal marriage or qualifying parent–child relationship.  
- Principal H-1B status valid.  
- Separate I-539 for each dependent if filed in U.S.  
- Maintain lawful stay equal to principal.

# Atomic claims
- H-4 status is limited to spouses and unmarried children under 21 of H-1B workers (critical: true)
- H-4 dependents cannot work unless separately authorized (critical: true)
- Each dependent must file Form I-539 to change or extend status (critical: false)
