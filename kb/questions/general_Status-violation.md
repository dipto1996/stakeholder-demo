# Short answer
Violating status—such as unauthorized work or overstaying I-94—can result in loss of legal presence, visa revocation, bars to reentry, and denial of future immigration benefits.

# Detailed guidance
- Unlawful presence begins the day after I-94 expiration or status violation.  
- Accumulating >180 days triggers 3-year reentry bar; >365 days triggers 10-year bar.  
- USCIS may deny extensions or changes of status.  
- Reinstatement or forgiveness may be available in limited cases (e.g., F-1 reinstatement).  
- Always depart or file to regain status promptly.  

# Key requirements
- Maintain valid status at all times.  
- Avoid unauthorized employment or overstays.  
- Track I-94 expiration dates.  
- Seek reinstatement or counsel if violation occurs.  

# Atomic claims
- Status violations lead to unlawful presence and potential reentry bans (critical: true)
- Accumulating over 180 days triggers 3-year bar; over 365 days triggers 10-year bar (critical: true)
- Some categories like F-1 have limited reinstatement options (critical: false)
