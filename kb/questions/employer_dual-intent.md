# Short answer
Dual intent allows H-1B and L-1 visa holders to seek permanent residence while maintaining their temporary status, enabling employers to sponsor green-card processes without violating nonimmigrant intent rules.

# Detailed guidance
- INA §214(b) presumes nonimmigrant intent for most visa types, but H-1B and L-1 are statutorily exempt.
- This permits concurrent pursuit of permanent residence while holding or extending these visas.
- Employers can safely initiate PERM and I-140 processes for employees on H-1B or L-1 status.
- Dual intent does not apply to F-1, J-1, or B-1/B-2 visas, which require strict nonimmigrant intent.
- Visa stamping and entry procedures remain unaffected for valid dual-intent classifications.

# Key requirements
- Applies only to H-1B and L-1 categories.  
- Allows green-card sponsorship while in nonimmigrant status.  
- Employer may begin PERM/I-140 process without risk.  
- Must maintain valid underlying nonimmigrant status.

# Atomic claims
- H-1B and L-1 classifications are dual intent under INA §214(b) (critical: true)
- Dual intent permits lawful pursuit of permanent residence while maintaining temporary status (critical: true)
- Employers may initiate green-card sponsorship without violating nonimmigrant intent (critical: false)
