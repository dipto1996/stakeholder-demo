# Short answer
Premium processing is an optional USCIS service allowing certain petitions, such as H-1B, L-1, and I-140, to be adjudicated within 15 calendar days for an additional fee using Form I-907.

# Detailed guidance
- Available for Form I-129 (H, L, O, P, etc.) and select I-140 categories.  
- Fee: $2,805 (as of 2025).  
- If USCIS fails to act in 15 days, it refunds the fee.  
- Does not guarantee approval—only faster decision.  
- Not all forms or categories qualify.  

# Key requirements
- File Form I-907 with or after principal petition.  
- Pay correct premium fee.  
- Monitor processing clock start date.  
- Use service for time-sensitive cases.  

# Atomic claims
- Premium processing guarantees 15-day adjudication for eligible petitions (critical: true)
- Service requires Form I-907 and additional fee (critical: true)
- Premium processing does not increase approval chances (critical: false)
