# Short answer
The employer's primary role is to confirm the continuing job offer and provide employment verification for the approved I-140 when the employee files Form I-485 for adjustment of status.

# Detailed guidance
- The I-485 is typically filed by the employee, not the employer, but the employer must:
  - Confirm that the job offer described in the I-140 remains valid.
  - Provide a letter confirming ongoing employment and job duties.
  - Notify USCIS if the offer is withdrawn before I-485 adjudication.
- Under INA §204(j), if the I-485 has been pending for 180 days or more, the employee may port to a same or similar job with a new employer.
- Employers are not responsible for the employee's personal documentation (e.g., medicals, biographical data).

# Key requirements
- Valid I-140 approval.  
- Written job offer confirmation.  
- Notification to USCIS if offer withdrawn.  
- Portability rules apply after 180 days.

# Atomic claims
- Employers must confirm continuing validity of job offer in I-140 petition (critical: true)
- Employees may port to same or similar job after 180 days under INA §204(j) (critical: true)
- Employers are not responsible for filing I-485 application itself (critical: false)
