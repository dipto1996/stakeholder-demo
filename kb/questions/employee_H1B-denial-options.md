# Short answer
After an H-1B denial, the employee may stay if eligible to file a motion to reopen/reconsider, appeal to the AAO, or have a new petition filed by the employer within the authorized grace period.

# Detailed guidance
- Denial notice specifies appeal rights and deadlines.  
- Employers may file Form I-290B within 30 days to appeal or reopen.  
- New employers can file a new petition if the employee maintains valid status or grace period (up to 60 days).  
- Departing the U.S. and reentering with a new approval is also an option.  
- Employees should consult counsel immediately to avoid unlawful presence.  

# Key requirements
- Timely I-290B filing for motions/appeals.  
- Maintain lawful status or use grace period.  
- Avoid unauthorized stay.  
- Evaluate refiling vs. appeal strategy.  

# Atomic claims
- Form I-290B must be filed within 30 days of H-1B denial to appeal or reopen (critical: true)
- Employees have 60-day grace period to find new employment or depart (critical: true)
- Unlawful presence starts after status expiration if no appeal or refiling occurs (critical: false)
