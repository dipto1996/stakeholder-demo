# Short answer
Only dependents who have valid work authorization, such as H-4 or L-2 spouses with EADs, may apply for a Social Security Number; others are ineligible.

# Detailed guidance
- SSA issues SSNs only to individuals authorized to work in the U.S.  
- L-2 spouses (automatic work authorization) and H-4 EAD holders qualify.  
- F-2, H-4 children, and dependents without EADs cannot obtain SSNs.  
- Those ineligible may request an ITIN for tax purposes instead.  

# Key requirements
- Valid EAD or automatic work authorization.  
- Passport, I-94, and immigration documents required.  
- Apply via SSA office in person.  
- ITIN if SSN ineligible.  

# Atomic claims
- Dependents can obtain SSNs only if they have work authorization (critical: true)
- L-2 spouses and H-4 EAD holders qualify for SSNs (critical: true)
- Dependents without work eligibility must use ITIN for taxes (critical: false)
