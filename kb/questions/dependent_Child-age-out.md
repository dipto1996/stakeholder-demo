# Short answer
If a dependent child turns 21 during the green-card process, the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) may allow them to retain "child" status by subtracting petition processing time from their age.

# Detailed guidance
- CSPA freezes a child's age during petition processing.  
- Applies to family-based, employment-based, and derivative beneficiaries.  
- "Adjusted age" = biological age – (I-140/I-130 pending time).  
- Must seek to acquire status within 1 year of visa availability.  
- Without CSPA coverage, the child must file separately.  

# Key requirements
- Under 21 adjusted CSPA age.  
- File or seek to acquire within 1 year.  
- Derivative relationship maintained.  
- Proper documentation for USCIS calculation.  

# Atomic claims
- CSPA allows certain dependents to retain eligibility after turning 21 (critical: true)
- Adjusted age equals biological age minus pending petition time (critical: true)
- Dependent must seek to acquire status within one year of visa availability (critical: false)
