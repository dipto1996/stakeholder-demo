# Short answer
If an H-4 visa is denied, the applicant may reapply with additional evidence, correct deficiencies noted by the consular officer, or seek review if the refusal was under INA §221(g).

# Detailed guidance
- Refusal under §221(g) = temporary administrative hold; submit missing documents.  
- Refusal under §214(b) = lack of nonimmigrant intent (rare for H-4s).  
- Review consulate notes via CEAC or FOIA for clarity.  
- Reapply once new evidence is available; no formal appeal for visa denials.  
- Ensure principal's H-1B status and documentation are valid.  

# Key requirements
- Address consular reason for refusal.  
- Submit corrected or additional evidence.  
- Maintain valid relationship with principal.  
- Reapply when ready.  

# Atomic claims
- H-4 visa denials under §221(g) may be overcome by providing additional evidence (critical: true)
- There is no formal appeal process for nonimmigrant visa denials (critical: true)
- Applicants may reapply once deficiencies are corrected (critical: false)
