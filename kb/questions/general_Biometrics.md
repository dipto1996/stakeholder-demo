# Short answer
During a biometrics appointment, USCIS collects fingerprints, a digital photo, and a signature for identity verification and background checks as part of the application process.

# Detailed guidance

- Bring the notice and valid photo ID (passport, driver's license, or EAD).  
- Biometrics taken at Application Support Center (ASC).  
- Data used for FBI and DHS security screening.  
- Missing an appointment can delay or deny the case.  

# Key requirements
- Attend at scheduled ASC location.  
- Bring required documents.  
- Reschedule if unable to attend.  
- Follow COVID or local security protocols.  

# Atomic claims
- Biometrics appointments collect fingerprints, photos, and signatures for security checks (critical: true)
- Failure to attend biometrics can delay or deny USCIS applications (critical: true)
- Applicants must bring I-797C notice and valid photo ID (critical: false)
