# Short answer
Employers must file a new LCA and an amended H-1B petition before the employee begins work at a new location outside the original area of intended employment.

# Detailed guidance
- Matter of Simeio Solutions, LLC established that a material change in work location requires an amended petition.
- Relocation within the same MSA only needs updated LCA posting.
- Move to a different MSA = new LCA + amended petition.
- Failure to amend before relocation violates H-1B terms.
- Employers should update the Public Access File with new postings and LCA copies.

# Key requirements
- Identify if relocation changes MSA.  
- File new LCA if outside area of intended employment.  
- File amended I-129 before move.  
- Update Public Access File records.

# Atomic claims
- Relocation outside MSA requires amended H-1B petition per Simeio Solutions (critical: true)
- Relocation within same MSA only requires LCA posting (critical: true)
- Failure to amend before relocation violates H-1B status (critical: false)
