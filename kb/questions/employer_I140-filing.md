# Short answer
After PERM approval, the employer files Form I-140 with USCIS to classify the worker in the appropriate employment-based category (EB-2 or EB-3) and must include the certified ETA-9089 and supporting evidence.

# Detailed guidance
- I-140 must be filed within 180 days of PERM certification.
- Include:
  - Original certified ETA-9089;
  - Proof of the company's ability to pay the proffered wage (tax returns, W-2s, etc.);
  - Proof of beneficiary's education and experience.
- Premium processing may be available.
- The petition classifies the beneficiary under EB-2 or EB-3.
- A new PERM is required if the position or employer materially changes.

# Key requirements
- File I-140 within 180 days of PERM approval.
