# Short answer
Dependents can apply for green cards as derivative beneficiaries once the principal applicant's I-485 or consular process is available, submitting Form I-485 or DS-260 with relationship proof.

# Detailed guidance
- Derivative eligibility applies to spouse and children under 21.  
- May adjust status concurrently or after the principal.  
- Visa Bulletin must show current priority date for both.  
- Dependents must maintain lawful status until filing.  
- If abroad, they apply via consular processing.  

# Key requirements
- Principal's approved I-140 or immigrant petition.  
- Valid marriage or parent–child proof.  
- Visa number available.  
- Separate Form I-485 or DS-260 per dependent.
