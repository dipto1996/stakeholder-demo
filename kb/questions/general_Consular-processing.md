# Short answer
Consular processing occurs when an applicant outside the U.S. applies for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate, whereas adjustment of status (AOS) is for applicants already in the U.S. filing Form I-485.

# Detailed guidance
- Consular processing involves DS-260 form, fees, and interview abroad.  
- AOS uses Form I-485 and allows staying in the U.S. during adjudication.  
- Once the visa is issued abroad, the applicant becomes a permanent resident upon U.S. entry.  
- Consular route may be faster for those outside the U.S.  

# Key requirements
- Choose route based on current location and eligibility.  
- Complete DS-260 via NVC for consular processing.  
- Submit I-485 if adjusting status within U.S.  
- Attend required interviews.  

# Atomic claims
- Consular processing occurs outside U.S.; AOS is filed within U.S. (critical: true)
- Form DS-260 is used for consular processing; I-485 for AOS (critical: true)
- Applicants become permanent residents upon entry with immigrant visa (critical: false)
