# Short answer
The priority date determines an applicant's place in line for a green card and is based on when the PERM or I-140 was filed; it must be current under the Department of State's Visa Bulletin to file or approve Form I-485.

# Detailed guidance
- Priority date = filing date of PERM or I-140 (if PERM exempt).  
- USCIS uses the Visa Bulletin to determine visa number availability.  
- Applicants may file or receive approval only when the priority date is earlier than the "Final Action Date."  
- Retained through job changes under AC21 portability.  
- Retrogression can delay I-485 adjudication.  

# Key requirements
- Monitor monthly Visa Bulletin.  
- Maintain same priority date through changes.  
- Understand retrogression impact.  
- Verify category and country of chargeability.
