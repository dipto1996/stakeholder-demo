# Short answer
Travel restrictions may temporarily prevent entry for certain visa holders due to health, security, or diplomatic reasons; restrictions vary by country and presidential proclamations.

- Can suspend entry for certain nationals or visa categories.  
- Essential workers, U.S. citizens, and green-card holders are generally exempt.  
- Visa issuance may continue, but entry delayed until restrictions lift.  
- Always check DOS and CDC notices before traveling.  

# Key requirements
- Review DOS and CDC updates before departure.  
- Carry supporting documents showing exemption, if applicable.  
- Confirm visa validity and entry eligibility.  
- Plan alternate travel routes if necessary.
