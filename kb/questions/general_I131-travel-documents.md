# Short answer
Form I-131 is used to request a travel document such as Advance Parole, a Refugee Travel Document, or a Reentry Permit, depending on the applicant's immigration status.

# Detailed guidance

- Select correct purpose on the form.  
- Provide evidence of status (I-485, green card, or asylum approval).  
- Avoid departing the U.S. before approval.  
- Carry document when reentering.
