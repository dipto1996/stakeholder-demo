# Short answer
Health insurance is not legally mandatory for dependents under U.S. immigration law, but it is strongly recommended and often required by schools, employers, or visa programs.

# Detailed guidance
- The Affordable Care Act no longer penalizes the uninsured federally (post-2019).  
- Some states (e.g., MA, NJ, CA) impose state-level mandates.  
- F-1/F-2 dependents may be required by schools to show coverage.  
- Employers often extend group insurance to H-4/L-2 dependents.  
- Private coverage recommended to avoid medical debt.  

# Key requirements
- Check state insurance mandates.  
- Maintain private or employer-based plan.  
- Verify school or sponsor requirements.  
- Keep coverage active while in U.S.  

# Atomic claims
- Health insurance is not federally mandated for dependents post-2019 (critical: true)
- Some states require residents to maintain health coverage (critical: true)
- Dependents should maintain insurance for medical and visa compliance purposes (critical: false)
