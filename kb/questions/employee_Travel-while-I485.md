# Short answer
Applicants may travel abroad only after receiving Advance Parole approval. Departing the U.S. without it abandons a pending I-485.

# Detailed guidance
- File Form I-131 for Advance Parole before travel.  
- Departing without Advance Parole = automatic I-485 abandonment (8 CFR §245.2(a)(4)(ii)(A)).  
- H-1B and L-1 holders may reenter on valid visa without AP.  
- Keep copies of I-485 receipt and AP document when traveling.  
- Re-entry inspection is at CBP discretion.  

# Key requirements
- File I-131 and receive Advance Parole.  
- Do not depart until approval.  
- Maintain underlying status if possible.  
- Carry AP document at entry.  

# Atomic claims
- Leaving U.S. without Advance Parole abandons pending I-485 (critical: true)
- H-1B and L-1 holders may reenter on valid visa status without Advance Parole (critical: true)
- Advance Parole must be approved before travel to avoid abandonment (critical: false)
