# Short answer
The employer must maintain a Public Access File for each H-1B worker containing the certified LCA, wage rate, prevailing wage data, and proof of notice posting, accessible to the public within one working day after filing the LCA.

  - Summary of benefits offered.
  - Evidence of notice posting.
- The file must be available at the principal place of business or worksite for public inspection.

- Include certified LCA and wage documentation.
