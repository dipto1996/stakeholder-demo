# Short answer
The Public Charge rule allows USCIS or consular officers to deny green card or visa applications if the applicant is likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance.

# Detailed guidance
- Defined under INA §212(a)(4).  
- Considers total circumstances — age, health, income, education, and family status.  
- Use of noncash benefits like Medicaid (except long-term care) does not count.  
- Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) may be required for family-based cases.  
- Employment-based applicants rarely affected unless no self-support.  

# Key requirements
- Submit I-864 or financial documentation when required.  
- Maintain private income and insurance.  
- Avoid reliance on long-term public assistance.  
- Understand which benefits count toward determination.  

# Atomic claims
- Public charge refers to likelihood of becoming dependent on government support (critical: true)
- USCIS assesses total circumstances including income and health (critical: true)
- Most noncash benefits do not trigger public charge inadmissibility (critical: false)
