# Short answer
Visas are most often refused for lack of eligibility, missing documents, or failure to demonstrate nonimmigrant intent under INA §214(b); other denials involve administrative processing or inadmissibility.

# Detailed guidance
- §214(b): Applicant failed to prove strong ties or nonimmigrant intent.  
- §221(g): Case pending for administrative or security checks.  
- §212(a): Grounds of inadmissibility (criminal, medical, or prior violations).  
- Many refusals are temporary and can be overcome with new evidence.  
- There is no appeal for visa refusals, but reapplication is permitted.  

# Key requirements
- Provide complete documentation.  
- Demonstrate intent consistent with visa type.  
- Address any inadmissibility issues.  
- Review refusal code for next steps.  

# Atomic claims
- Most visa denials result from failure to prove eligibility or nonimmigrant intent under §214(b) (critical: true)
- Administrative refusals under §221(g) can be resolved by providing additional documents (critical: true)
- Applicants may reapply but cannot formally appeal visa refusals (critical: false)
