# Short answer
H-4 dependents extend status by filing Form I-539 with proof of relationship and the principal H-1B extension receipt or approval.

# Detailed guidance
- File I-539 before current I-94 expires.  
- Include principal's I-797 receipt/approval, passport copies, and marriage/birth certificates.  
- Can file together with principal's I-129 for concurrent processing.  
- H-4 validity matches principal's new approval.  

# Key requirements
- Timely I-539 filing.  
- Valid relationship proof.  
- Principal H-1B status continuing.  
- I-94 validity aligned with principal.  

# Atomic claims
- H-4 extensions require Form I-539 with supporting documents (critical: true)
- Status period matches principal H-1B approval (critical: true)
- Late filings risk unlawful presence (critical: false)
