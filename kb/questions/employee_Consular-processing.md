# Short answer
During H-1B consular processing, the applicant attends a visa interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, presents required documents, and receives an H-1B visa stamp in their passport before traveling to the U.S.

# Detailed guidance
- Schedule an interview via the embassy or consulate website after petition approval.  
- Prepare documents: I-797 approval notice, DS-160, passport, photo, LCA, and employment letter.  
- The officer verifies eligibility, job details, and nonimmigrant intent.  
- Administrative processing (221g) may delay issuance.  
- Once approved, visa validity typically aligns with petition validity.  

# Key requirements
- Approved I-797 petition.  
- Completed DS-160 form and visa fee payment.  
- Required documentation and interview attendance.  
- Clear background and security checks.  

# Atomic claims
- Consular processing requires in-person visa interview with supporting documentation (critical: true)
- Administrative processing under 221(g) can delay visa issuance (critical: true)
- Visa validity usually matches petition validity period (critical: false)
