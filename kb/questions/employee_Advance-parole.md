# Short answer
Advance Parole permits individuals with pending I-485 applications to travel abroad and return to the U.S. without abandoning their adjustment of status application.

# Detailed guidance
- File Form I-131 while the I-485 is pending.  
- Leaving the U.S. without approved Advance Parole results in automatic abandonment.  
- H-1B/L-1 visa holders may reenter with valid visa status instead.  
- Advance Parole validity typically matches pending I-485 period.  
- Does not guarantee admission—final decision rests with CBP.  

# Key requirements
- Pending I-485 at time of filing.  
- Do not depart before approval.  
- Maintain valid status or EAD.  
- Present AP document at reentry.  

# Atomic claims
- Advance Parole allows reentry without abandoning pending I-485 (critical: true)
- Departing without Advance Parole automatically abandons adjustment (critical: true)
- CBP retains discretion at entry even with valid Advance Parole (critical: false)
