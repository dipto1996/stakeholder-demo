# Short answer
Employers must obtain and post an LCA for each worksite and, where the new worksite is outside the original area of intended employment, file an amended H-1B petition with USCIS.

# Detailed guidance
- Each location where the H-1B employee works requires LCA coverage.
- If the new worksite is within the same metropolitan area, only posting is needed.
- For new locations outside the MSA, employers must:
  - Obtain a new certified LCA.
  - File an amended I-129 petition.
- Third-party placements require documentation of employer–employee control.
- Short-term placements under 20 CFR §655.735 are limited exceptions.

# Key requirements
- LCA for every active worksite.  
- Amendment if moving outside MSA.  
- Maintain documentation of placement and control.  
- Follow short-term placement limits.

# Atomic claims

- Worksite changes outside MSA require amended petition (critical: true)
