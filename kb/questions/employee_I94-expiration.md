# Short answer
The I-94 record, not the visa stamp, controls the authorized stay in the U.S.; if the I-94 expires, the individual must stop working and depart or file an extension immediately.

# Detailed guidance
- Visa stamp = entry document; I-94 = authorized stay.  
- Once I-94 expires, status ends regardless of visa validity.  
- Late filing within 14 days may be excused for extraordinary circumstances.  
- Overstay can trigger unlawful presence and future visa bars.  
- Always verify I-94 dates after entry.  

# Key requirements
- Monitor I-94 expiration closely.  
- File extension before expiry.  
- Cease employment if I-94 lapses.  
- Keep copies of I-94 and I-797 notices.  

# Atomic claims
- I-94 controls authorized stay not visa stamp (critical: true)
- Working after I-94 expiration is unauthorized (critical: true)
- Late filing may be forgiven for extraordinary circumstances within 14 days (critical: false)
