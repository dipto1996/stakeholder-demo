# Short answer
Form I-797 is a notice USCIS issues to communicate case actions, such as receipt, approval, transfer, or request for additional information.

# Detailed guidance
- Common types:  
  - I-797C = Receipt or Transfer Notice.  
  - I-797A = Approval + I-94 (for in-country status).  
  - I-797B = Approval without I-94 (for consular processing).  
  - I-797E = RFE notice.  
- Retain for records; critical for visa stamping and work authorization.  
- Does not substitute for a visa or legal entry.  

# Key requirements
- Keep all I-797 notices securely.  
- Check notice type and expiration details.
