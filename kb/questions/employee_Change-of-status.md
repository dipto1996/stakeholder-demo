# Short answer
To change from F-1 to H-1B, the employer must file Form I-129 requesting a change of status before the F-1 student's authorized stay or OPT period expires.

# Detailed guidance
- Employer files I-129 with certified LCA and change-of-status request.  
- Student must remain in valid F-1 or OPT status until approval.  
- If approved, status changes automatically on October 1.  
- Departing the U.S. before approval voids the change of status—consular stamping is then required.  
- Grace period of 60 days applies after OPT expiry.  

# Key requirements
- Timely I-129 filing before F-1 status ends.  
- Continuous lawful stay.  
- No travel before approval.  
- New I-94 issued upon approval.
