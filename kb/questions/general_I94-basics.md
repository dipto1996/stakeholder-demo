# Short answer
The I-94 is an electronic record issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) showing the nonimmigrant's authorized period of stay, which governs legal presence in the U.S.

# Detailed guidance
- Available online via CBP portal for arrivals after 2013.  
- Includes admission class (e.g., H-1B, F-1) and expiration ("Admit Until Date").  
- If marked "D/S" (Duration of Status), valid as long as status continues (e.g., F-1).  
- Overstaying I-94 triggers unlawful presence and penalties.  
- Must be updated after each entry.  

# Key requirements
- Verify I-94 details after each arrival.  
- Track "Admit Until" date, not visa expiry.  
- Retain printed copy for records.  
- Report discrepancies to CBP Deferred Inspection office.  

# Atomic claims
- I-94 record determines lawful stay duration in U.S. (critical: true)
- Visa expiration does not control status; I-94 does (critical: true)
- Travelers can retrieve I-94 record online from CBP (critical: false)
