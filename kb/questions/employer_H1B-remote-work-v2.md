# Short answer
Yes, but employers must comply with LCA and amendment rules. A new LCA and amended Form I-129 are required when an H-1B worker's primary work location changes to a different metropolitan area.

# Detailed guidance
- **Matter of Simeio Solutions, LLC** (26 I&N Dec 542 AAO 2015) requires an amended petition when a material change occurs in the worksite location.
- Short-term placement (≤ 30 days, 20 CFR § 655.735) and non-worksite placements may be exempt.
- Remote work within the same area of intended employment may only require LCA posting, not an amendment.
- The employer must post LCA notices electronically or physically at remote worksites.
- Each new worksite outside the original MSA requires a new LCA and amended I-129.

# Key requirements
- Determine if new location is within same MSA.  
- Post LCA notices at remote worksite.  
- File amended petition if worksite changes materially.  
- Maintain Public Access File records for each LCA.

# Atomic claims
- Employers must file amended H-1B petition for material worksite changes (critical: true)
- Remote work within same MSA requires LCA posting but not amendment (critical: true)
- Short-term placements under 20 CFR § 655.735 may be exempt from amendment requirements (critical: false)
