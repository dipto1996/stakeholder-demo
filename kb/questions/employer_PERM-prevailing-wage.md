# Short answer
Employers must request a Prevailing Wage Determination (PWD) from the DOL's National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC) using Form ETA-9141, based on the position, location, and requirements.

# Detailed guidance
- Prevailing wage is the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in the area of intended employment (20 CFR §656.40).
- Employers must file ETA-9141 through the FLAG portal, specifying:
  - Job title and duties;
  - Education and experience requirements;
  - Worksite address(es).
- DOL assigns a wage level (I–IV) based on complexity and required skills.
- The certified wage remains valid for the recruitment period and up to 90 days beyond issuance.
- Using an uncertified wage or underpaying can invalidate PERM.

# Key requirements
- Submit ETA-9141 to NPWC via FLAG.  
- Use accurate job description and location.  
- Observe validity period of the PWD.  
- Maintain documentation for audit.
