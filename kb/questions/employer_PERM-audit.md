# Short answer
Employers must retain complete recruitment and PWD documentation for five years and respond to any DOL audit request within the specified deadline, typically 30 days.

# Detailed guidance

- Employers should maintain:
  - Copies of advertisements and job orders;
  - Resumes received and evaluation notes;
  - PWD and recruitment report;
  - Signed ETA-9089.
- Audits are either random or targeted; failure to respond results in denial.
- DOL may impose supervised recruitment if irregularities are found.
- Records must be stored securely for five years after filing.

# Key requirements
- Maintain full audit file for 5 years.  
- Respond to audit request within deadline.  
- Provide truthful and complete records.  
- Cooperate with supervised recruitment if imposed.
