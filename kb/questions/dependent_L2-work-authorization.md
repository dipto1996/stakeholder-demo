# Short answer
Yes. As of November 2021, L-2 spouses are incidentally work-authorized and no longer require an EAD; the I-94 annotated "L-2S" serves as proof of employment authorization.

# Detailed guidance
- CBP issues I-94 showing "L-2S." That record = EAD equivalent.  
- Existing EADs remain valid but not required to continue working.  
- L-2 children are not authorized to work.  
- Employers must use I-94 for I-9 verification.  

# Key requirements
- Valid L-2 spouse status.  
- I-94 annotated "L-2S."  
- No separate I-765 needed.  
- Maintain lawful status.  

# Atomic claims
- L-2 spouses automatically have work authorization as of Nov 2021 (critical: true)
- Children (L-2 dependents) are not authorized to work (critical: true)
- I-94 with 'L-2S' notation serves as proof of work authorization (critical: false)
