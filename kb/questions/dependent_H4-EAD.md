# Short answer
H-4 spouses may apply for an EAD by filing Form I-765 if the principal H-1B worker has an approved I-140 or AC21 extension beyond six years.

# Detailed guidance
- File Form I-765 under category (C)(26).  
- Include proof of marriage, principal's I-140 approval or AC21 eligibility, and H-4 status proof.  
- EAD validity matches H-4 status period.  
- Renew ≤ 180 days before expiration.  

# Key requirements
- Approved I-140 or AC21 extension.  
- Valid H-4 status.  
- Proper I-765 package + fee.  
- Timely renewal filing.

# Atomic claims
- Only H-4 spouses (not children) may apply for EAD under category C(26) (critical: true)
- Principal must have approved I-140 or AC21 eligibility (critical: true)
- EAD expires concurrently with H-4 status (critical: false)
