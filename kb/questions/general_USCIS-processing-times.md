# Short answer
Processing times vary by form type and service center; applicants can check current estimates on the USCIS Processing Times page using their form and receipt number prefix.

# Detailed guidance
- Typical timeframes range from a few weeks (EADs) to over a year (I-485).  
- Each form type has a designated service center: e.g., SRC = Texas, LIN = Nebraska, WAC = California, EAC = Vermont.  
- Delays may occur due to background checks, volume, or RFEs.  
- Applicants can submit an "outside normal processing time" inquiry online after the posted maximum date passes.  
- Premium processing (Form I-907) speeds up select petitions.  

# Key requirements
- Check the USCIS portal for accurate timelines.  
- Use the receipt number prefix to identify the service center.  
- Submit inquiry if case exceeds normal range.  
- Consider premium processing where available.  

# Atomic claims
- USCIS processing times depend on form type and service center workload (critical: true)
