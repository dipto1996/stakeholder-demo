# Short answer
STEM graduates on post-completion OPT may apply for a 24-month extension by filing Form I-765 with USCIS before their current OPT EAD expires, if their employer is E-Verify-enrolled and uses Form I-983 training plan.

# Detailed guidance
- Student must hold a degree in a DHS-designated STEM field.  
- Employer must be E-Verify-enrolled and sign Form I-983 training plan.  
- File Form I-765 for extension within 90 days before current EAD expires.  
- Maintain F-1 status and report employment changes to DSO within 10 days.  
- 24-month period can follow 12-month post-completion OPT.  

# Key requirements
- STEM-eligible degree.  
- E-Verify employer + Form I-983.  
- Timely Form I-765 filing.  
- DSO endorsement on Form I-20.
