# Short answer
A visa allows entry to the U.S., while status (shown on Form I-94) governs how long a person can stay; a valid visa does not guarantee lawful presence after I-94 expiration.

# Detailed guidance
- Visa = entry document issued by DOS.  
- I-94 = record of authorized stay by CBP.  
- Overstaying I-94 = unlawful presence, even with valid visa stamp.  
- Visa validity can extend across multiple entries.  
- Always check I-94 "Admit Until Date" after each entry.  

# Key requirements
- Verify I-94 after each entry.  
- Depart or extend before I-94 expiration.  
- Renew visa only if leaving the U.S.  
- Distinguish entry rights from stay duration.  

# Atomic claims
- Visa validity controls entry; I-94 controls authorized stay (critical: true)
- Overstaying I-94 causes unlawful presence even with valid visa (critical: true)
- Visa and status are distinct legal concepts (critical: false)
