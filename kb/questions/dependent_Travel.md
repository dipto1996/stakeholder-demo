# Short answer
Dependents may travel abroad while the principal's petition is pending, but must ensure valid visa and approval notice for reentry; travel can delay or abandon certain applications like I-539 or I-485.

# Detailed guidance
- If dependent has a valid visa and I-94, travel is permitted.  
- Departure during pending I-539 may result in abandonment.  
- Departure during pending I-485 without Advance Parole = automatic abandonment.  
- Always carry principal's I-797 and status evidence when reentering.  

# Key requirements
- Valid visa for reentry.  
- Avoid travel if I-539 or I-485 pending.  
- Carry principal's documentation.  
- Check CBP admission dates.  

# Atomic claims
- Travel during pending I-539 or I-485 may lead to application abandonment (critical: true)
- Dependents must carry valid visa and proof of principal's status when returning (critical: true)
- Advance Parole is required if dependent's I-485 is pending (critical: false)
