# Short answer
An H-1B employee may begin working for a new employer as soon as USCIS receives a properly filed transfer petition, provided they are in valid H-1B status at the time of filing.

# Detailed guidance
- New employer files Form I-129 with certified LCA.  
- Employment can start upon USCIS receipt ("portability").  
- Prior H-1B status must be uninterrupted.  
- If petition is denied, employment must cease immediately.  
- Maintain copies of approval and pay records to prove status.  

# Key requirements
- Valid H-1B status on filing date.  
- Certified LCA for new employer.  
- USCIS receipt notice for portability.  
- Cease work if petition denied.  

# Atomic claims
- H-1B portability permits work upon receipt of new petition (critical: true)
- Maintaining unbroken status is required for portability eligibility (critical: true)
- Employment must stop if USCIS denies transfer petition (critical: false)
