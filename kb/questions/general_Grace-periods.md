# Short answer
Most nonimmigrant workers, including H-1B, L-1, and O-1 visa holders, have a 60-day grace period after job loss or until their I-94 expires—whichever is shorter—to find new employment, change status, or depart the U.S.

# Detailed guidance
- Grace period applies once per authorized validity period.  
- The 60 days begin from termination date or I-94 end date.  
- During this period, the individual may not work unless a new petition is filed.  
- Dependents also remain in status for the same grace period.  
- Failure to act results in unlawful presence.  

# Key requirements
- Termination documented in writing.  
- New petition or change of status filed before grace period ends.  
- No unauthorized employment.  
- Departure if no new petition pending.  

# Atomic claims
- Nonimmigrant workers have up to 60 days or until I-94 expiry as grace period (critical: true)
- Dependents remain in status during principal's grace period (critical: true)
- Unauthorized work is prohibited during grace period (critical: false)
