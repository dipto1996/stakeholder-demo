# Short answer
An L-2 dependent may change to H-4 status by filing Form I-539 with proof of relationship, the principal's H-1B approval, and evidence of valid L-2 status at the time of filing.

# Detailed guidance
- File Form I-539 before I-94 expiration.  
- Include copies of principal's H-1B I-797, marriage/birth certificates, passports, and current I-94.  
- Processing takes several months; no work allowed while pending.  
- Departure before approval requires consular visa stamping for H-4.  

# Key requirements
- Valid L-2 status during filing.  
- Principal H-1B approval notice.  
- Proper I-539 with supporting evidence.  
- No employment while pending.  

# Atomic claims
- L-2 dependents must file Form I-539 to change to H-4 status (critical: true)
- Filing must occur before L-2 I-94 expiration (critical: true)
- Work authorization ends upon filing until H-4 approval (critical: false)
