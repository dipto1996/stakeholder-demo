# Short answer
Under the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21), employees with pending I-485s for 180 days or more may change jobs if the new position is in the same or similar occupational classification.

# Detailed guidance
- INA §204(j) permits I-485 portability after 180 days of pending adjudication.  
- New employer does not need to file a new PERM if job duties are similar.  
- USCIS compares SOC codes, duties, and wage levels to assess similarity.  
- Employee must provide new employment offer letter during adjudication.  
- Portability preserves priority date and underlying petition validity.  

# Key requirements
- I-485 pending ≥180 days.  
- New job same or similar occupation.  
- Offer letter and evidence of bona fide employment.  
- No material change invalidating I-140.
