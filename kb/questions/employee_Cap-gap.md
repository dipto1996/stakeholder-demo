# Short answer
The Cap-Gap extension automatically extends an F-1 student's status and, if applicable, OPT work authorization until October 1 when a timely filed H-1B change-of-status petition is pending or approved.

# Detailed guidance
- Applies when an employer files an H-1B petition before the F-1 status or OPT expires.  
- Automatically extends stay and work authorization to bridge the gap between OPT end and H-1B start (October 1).  
- If the petition is rejected, withdrawn, or denied, the extension immediately ends.  
- Students should request an updated I-20 from their DSO reflecting Cap-Gap status.  
- Travel abroad during Cap-Gap is strongly discouraged.

# Key requirements
- Timely filed H-1B petition with change-of-status request.  
- F-1 status and OPT valid on filing date.  
- Updated I-20 with Cap-Gap notation.  
- No travel during Cap-Gap period.

# Atomic claims
- Cap-Gap automatically extends F-1 status and work authorization to October 1 (critical: true)
- Extension ends immediately if H-1B petition is denied or withdrawn (critical: true)
- Students should obtain updated I-20 showing Cap-Gap coverage (critical: false)
