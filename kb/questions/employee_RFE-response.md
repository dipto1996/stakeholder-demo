# Short answer
Employees must submit a complete and timely response to the USCIS RFE by the deadline listed, addressing every point raised and including all requested evidence.

- Review the RFE notice carefully for specific deficiencies.  
- Gather requested documentation or expert evaluations.  
- Submit a single consolidated response before the due date.  
- No extensions allowed unless USCIS grants special accommodation.  
- Failure to respond results in denial.  

# Key requirements
- Respond by stated deadline.  
- Address each request fully.  
- Use attorney cover letter summarizing evidence.  
- Retain copies of submission.

- USCIS rarely grants RFE response extensions (critical: false)
