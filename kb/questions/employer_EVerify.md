# Short answer
E-Verify participation is generally voluntary for most employers, but it is mandatory for certain federal contractors and in specific states that require it by law.

# Detailed guidance
- E-Verify is an internet-based system operated by DHS and SSA to confirm employment eligibility.
- Federal contractors with the FAR E-Verify clause (48 CFR §52.222-54) must enroll.
- States such as Arizona and Alabama require all employers to use E-Verify.
- H-1B dependent employers are not automatically required to use E-Verify, though participation may expedite certain processes.
- Employers must still complete Form I-9 for all hires.

# Key requirements
- Enroll if federal contract or state law mandates.  
- Continue completing Form I-9.  
- Follow DHS user guidelines and retention rules.  
- Ensure no discrimination in verification process.
