# Short answer
Employers may request H-1B extensions beyond six years if the worker has a pending or approved PERM labor certification or I-140 petition, or if time spent outside the U.S. is recaptured.

# Detailed guidance
- Under AC21 §104(c), workers with an approved I-140 and no available visa number may receive one-year increments until green-card completion.
- Under §106(a)–(b), if a PERM or I-140 has been pending ≥ 365 days, extensions may be granted.
- Time abroad can be "recaptured" by documenting travel.
- Each extension requires a new LCA and I-129 filing.
- Employers should maintain evidence of travel and petition history.

# Key requirements
- Pending or approved I-140 or PERM ≥ 365 days old.  
- No available visa number.  
- Valid LCA and employer–employee relationship.
