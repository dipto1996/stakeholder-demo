# Short answer
The Visa Bulletin, published monthly by the U.S. Department of State, shows when immigrant visa numbers are available based on category and country, determining when applicants can file or receive green-card approvals.

# Detailed guidance
- Priority date = date the immigrant petition or labor certification was filed.  
- When the Visa Bulletin "Final Action Date" passes the priority date, the applicant's case becomes current.  
- "Dates for Filing" chart indicates when applicants can submit Form I-485.  
- Employment-based categories are subject to per-country limits.  
- USCIS announces monthly which chart to use for adjustment filings.  

# Key requirements
- Monitor monthly Visa Bulletin.  
- Know your category and country of chargeability.  
- Compare your priority date to the "Final Action Date."  
- File only when eligible per USCIS guidance.
