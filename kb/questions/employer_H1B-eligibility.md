# Short answer
An employer may sponsor an H-1B worker if the offered position qualifies as a "specialty occupation," the beneficiary has the required degree or equivalent, and the employer files a valid Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Department of Labor and Form I-129 with USCIS.

# Detailed guidance
- The job must require a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty (8 CFR § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)).
- The worker must possess at least a U.S. bachelor's or equivalent foreign degree in that specialty.
- The employer must:
  - Obtain a certified LCA from DOL (20 CFR § 655.700 et seq.);
  - Offer the prevailing wage;
  - Maintain a Public Access File; and
  - Submit Form I-129 H-1B petition with supporting documentation and fees.
- Cap-subject petitions are entered in the annual lottery unless exempt.
- Employers must demonstrate an employer–employee relationship (see Neufeld Memo 2010).

# Key requirements
- Specialty-occupation position.  
- Qualified foreign national.  
- Certified LCA.  
- Proper filing and fee payment.  
- Employer–employee control demonstrated.
