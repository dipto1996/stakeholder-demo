# Short answer
An RFE is a USCIS notice requesting additional evidence to decide a pending application; applicants must respond by the deadline with complete documentation or risk denial.

# Detailed guidance
- Issued when initial evidence is insufficient.  
- Lists deficiencies and requested documents.  
- Respond by stated deadline (usually 30–90 days).  
- Late or incomplete responses may lead to denial.  
- RFEs differ from NOIDs (intent to deny notices).  

# Key requirements
- Read RFE notice carefully.  
- Submit all requested evidence in one package.  
- Respond before the deadline.  
- Keep copies for records.  

# Atomic claims
- RFEs are issued when USCIS needs additional information to make decision (critical: true)
- Failure to respond fully and timely results in case denial (critical: true)
- RFEs and NOIDs serve different purposes under USCIS policy (critical: false)
