# Short answer
Dependents must file taxes only if they earn U.S. income; those without SSNs must obtain an ITIN to be claimed as dependents on the principal taxpayer's return.

# Detailed guidance
- If dependent earns income, must file Form 1040-NR or 1040.  
- Nonworking dependents: obtain ITIN via Form W-7 to be listed on the taxpayer's return.  
- F-2/H-4 children generally file jointly through the principal's return.  
- Resident status for tax purposes may differ from immigration status (substantial presence test).  

# Key requirements
- File taxes if any U.S. income earned.  
- Obtain ITIN if no SSN.  
- Include dependents properly in return.  
- Understand nonresident vs. resident taxation.  

# Atomic claims
- Dependents with U.S. income must file tax returns (critical: true)
- Dependents without SSNs must obtain ITINs via Form W-7 (critical: true)
- Tax residency rules differ from immigration status (critical: false)
