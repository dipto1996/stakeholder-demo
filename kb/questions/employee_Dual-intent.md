# Short answer
Dual intent allows certain nonimmigrant visa holders, such as those in H-1B and L-1 status, to pursue permanent residency without violating the terms of their current visa.

# Detailed guidance
- Most visa holders must show nonimmigrant intent under INA §214(b).  
- H-1B and L-1 are exceptions — they allow pursuing a green card while maintaining nonimmigrant status.  
- Dual intent protects status even during PERM or I-140 processing.  
- Travel for stamping remains permitted despite immigrant intent.  
- Does not apply to F-1, J-1, or B categories.  

# Key requirements
- Applies only to H-1B and L-1.  
- No violation of status during immigrant processing.  
- Maintain valid nonimmigrant petition and employment.  
- Continue compliance with USCIS rules.  

# Atomic claims
- H-1B and L-1 visa holders are recognized as dual intent under INA §214(b) (critical: true)
- Dual intent permits pursuing green card while in valid nonimmigrant status (critical: true)
- Dual intent does not apply to F-1 or J-1 visa holders (critical: false)
