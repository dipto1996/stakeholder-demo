# Short answer
The annual H-1B cap limits new petitions to 85,000 (65,000 regular + 20,000 U.S. master's exemptions). Employers must register electronically with USCIS during the cap window and file full petitions for selected registrations.

# Detailed guidance
- INA §214(g) sets numerical limits.  
- Registration opens each March; selected registrants have ≈ 90 days to file Form I-129.  
- Cap-exempt employers (Universities, non-profits, government research) may file any time.  
- Duplicate registrations for the same beneficiary are barred.  
- Employers should prepare supporting evidence early and ensure LCA certification before petition submission.

# Key requirements
- Timely electronic registration.  
- Certified LCA for filed petitions.  
- Payment of ACWIA and anti-fraud fees.  
- Maintain records of lottery selection and filing.
