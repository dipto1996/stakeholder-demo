# Short answer
H-1B employers must pay the required wage, provide equivalent benefits, maintain working conditions for U.S. workers, and post LCA notices at the place of employment as required by 20 CFR §655.

# Detailed guidance
- Employers must:
  - Pay at least the higher of the actual or prevailing wage.
  - Provide benefits on the same terms as U.S. workers.
  - Not displace U.S. workers or place H-1B workers at secondary sites where U.S. workers are displaced.
  - Post LCA notices for ten consecutive business days.
  - Cooperate with DOL investigations.
- Violations can lead to fines, debarment, and back wage orders.

# Key requirements
- Wage and benefits parity.  
- LCA posting and retention.  
- Non-displacement of U.S. workers.  
- DOL cooperation and recordkeeping.
